# Overview

This project investigates the relationship between socioeconomic and environmental factors and gun violence in California using geospatial data science techniques and the ArcGIS platform. The analysis explores how variables like proximity to police stations, income levels, unemployment rates, incarceration rates, and mental health statistics influence the frequency and severity of shootings, including mass shootings.

## Key Highlights:
- **Geospatial Analysis**: Integrated datasets on shootings, county demographics, and police station locations to analyze spatial patterns and relationships.
- **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Combined and processed diverse datasets, geocoded city-level data to counties, and applied transformations for effective analysis.
- **Machine Learning Models**: 
  - Developed a **linear regression model** to predict the number of victims per incident, achieving an RMSE of 0.93.
  - Used a **logistic regression model** to classify shootings as mass killings (â‰¥3 fatalities) with balanced datasets.
- **Visualizations**: Created choropleth maps to illustrate demographic distributions (income, unemployment, depression rates) and shooting trends across counties.
- **Insights**: Identified significant correlations between socioeconomic conditions and gun violence, highlighting how income inequality and mental health challenges are associated with shooting severity.
